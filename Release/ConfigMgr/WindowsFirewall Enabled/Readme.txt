Simple script to ensure Windows Firewall service is set to automatic and started.
**Note that this remediation script clears all rules, and sets the firewall completely open. This is good from a logging perspective, but you may need to modify your configuration. The intent with this script is to get the firewall on (because it has been disabled), with no impact to the environment.
